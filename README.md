Titanfall Legends is a mod for Northstar (Titanfall 2), this mod add a new game mode: Battle Royale.

Players will join a lobby and once the minimum required number of players has been reached, a vote for the map (of the Battle Royale) will take place. Once this vote has ended, the Battle Royale game will begin. The lobby is a classic FFA mod.

The mod has great [customization](https://github.com/AlphaGaming7780/Thunderdome#documentation) possibilities by modifying the [ConVars](https://r2northstar.gitbook.io/r2northstar-wiki/hosting-a-server-with-northstar/dedicated-server#documentation) and the [PlaylitsVars](https://r2northstar.gitbook.io/r2northstar-wiki/hosting-a-server-with-northstar/dedicated-server#playlist-overrides) of the game mode, for example, you can disable chest spawn, enable random weapon donation at spawn and end up with a FFADM (Free For All Death Match).
