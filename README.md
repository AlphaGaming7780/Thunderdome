# Thunderdome

Thunderdome is a mod for Northstar (Titanfall 2), this mod add a new game mode: Battle Royale.

Players will join a lobby and once the minimum required number of players has been reached, a vote for the map (of the Battle Royale or the game mode you create) will take place. Once this vote has ended, the Battle Royale game (or the game mode you create) will begin. The lobby is a classic FFA mod.

The mod has great [customization](https://github.com/AlphaGaming7780/Thunderdome#documentation) possibilities by modifying the [ConVars](https://r2northstar.gitbook.io/r2northstar-wiki/hosting-a-server-with-northstar/dedicated-server#convars) and the [PlaylitsVars](https://r2northstar.gitbook.io/r2northstar-wiki/hosting-a-server-with-northstar/dedicated-server#playlist-overrides) of the game mode, for example, you can disable chest spawn, enable random weapon donation at spawn and end up with a FFADM (Free For All Death Match, I don't know how to call this).
